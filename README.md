# 14-belly-button-challenge
In this week's assignment, we had to create an interactive dashboard to dynamically look at the microbes of the human navel in test subjects.  The link to the dashboard is https://ktball.github.io/14-belly-button-challenge/Starter_Code/StarterCode/index.html.
I completed this assignment by watching the class zoom recordings, Learning Assistant, AskBCS where I worked with Shivek Mantosh, and Chatgpt.
